# Node, Python, pyenv and Conda Notes

## Start a Virtual Environment 

See the [pyenv](#pyenv) steps below if you need to run a different version of python.

Always using a virtualenv is a best-practice for protecting your OS.

	python3 -m venv env
	source env/bin/activate

For Windows,

	python3 -m venv env
	.\env\Scripts\activate


<!--
If pip install doesn't run, and you see (base), then deactivate the conda base environment:

	conda deactivate
-->

## Node and npm

Check your versions. nvm optional.

	node -v
	npm -v

[npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) recommends installing the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission errors when you run npm packages globally.  
Run `nvm ls` to see all the node versions you have installed. Update nvm to set your version of node:

**To install nvm** Use the [curl command to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).  Then run the export command below it. Restart your terminal.  
One a Mac since OS X 10.9, first run `touch ~/.zshrc`.

**Set your node version to v20**

	nvm install 20.14.0
	nvm use 20.14.0

We're avoiding node v22 because it has a [punycode error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68774489/punycode-is-deprecated-in-npm-what-should-i-replace-it-with) in data-commons build.  Run the above BEFORE invoking a virtual environment.

<!--
To installing node if the version commands find nothing:

	nvm install --lts --reinstall-packages-from=current
	nvm install node
	nvm alias default node
-->

**If you're not using Node Version Manager (nvm)** (above)
You can [install node/npm directly](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The installer includes the Node.js package manager (npm) within it, so you won't need to install npm separately.  
Skip this if you are using nvm (above). This directly updates your machine to the latest stable version of NodeJS.
<!-- https://askubuntu.com/questions/426750/how-can-i-update-my-nodejs-to-the-latest-version-->

	npm install -g n &&
	sudo n stable


## Python

Check python version (may differ in your virtual environments)
Only python3 was available after running `brew install python` after upgrading to Mac Sonoma OS.

	python --version
	python3 --version


If your python version is older, you may want to upgrade Python to 3.10 or 3.11.  
3.10 is needed for the Nature journal Exiobase download for Sankey.  
3.11 is currently used for the OpenWebUI build as of as of Jul 22, 2024.
3.12 does not work for the two above, use pyenv.

If you don't have brew yet, [download the .pkg installer](https://brew.sh).
You might also get a dialog to install xcode.

	brew install python

## pyenv - for multiple versions of python

Check if you have pyenv installed: `pyenv --version`
If not, you can [install pyenv with homebrew](https://mac.install.guide/python/install-pyenv) or [with pip on Windows](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

List the Python versions installed on your machine:

	ls -l /usr/local/bin/python*

If your newest python version is python 2 or older, upgrade your machine's OS. 


Sample of running python 3.10 for [Exiobase sankey trade data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/Mapping-global-ghg-emissions):

pyenv local 3.10  # Creates .python-version

	pyenv install 3.10  # Skip if you've already installed
	pyenv local 3.10
	python3.10 -m venv env  # Before re-running, delete the existing env folder, or skip this line and reuse the env folder.
	source env/bin/activate  # On Windows .\env\Scripts\activate
	python --version

Even in a virtual environment, "pyenv global" will update your machine.
[For OpenWebUI projects](/projects/location/setup) you can use the technique above to use Python 3.11.
Python 3.12 was not compatible with the OpenWebUI build as of Jul 22, 2024.

To move your entire machine default forward, run `pyenv global 3.12.2`

	pyenv install 3.12.2
	pyenv global 3.12.2


If you need to use a prior version of Python,  
view what's installed `pyenv virtualenvs`
Here's an alternative to `-m venv env`

	pyenv install 3.7.17
	pyenv local 3.7.17
	pyenv virtualenv 3.7.17 myenv
	pyenv activate myenv

To delete the current pyenv environment use `pyenv deactivate` since you won't have a myenv folder.

## pip

How to stop your virtual environment and update pip.  
Once in a virtual environment, avoid appending 3 (as in pip3 or python3) .

	ctrl-c
	python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
	pip -V

<!--
To check which shell you are using:

	echo $SHELL

If your shell is zsh, open .zshrc in your home directory. Add at the end of the file:
Wasn't in there, and currently running python 3.12

	export PATH="/Users/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"

Replace with the actual path where your python pip scripts are located.

Close the current and open a new terminal window for the updated configuration.
Type `echo $PATH` to verify.
-->

## Conda

View a list of your conda environments.
If none are found, [download from Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download) - Open by clicking the Anaconda app. Reopen your terminals.

	conda env list  

A new install places at:
base * /opt/anaconda3

You can delete any unnecessary ones with `conda remove --name [ENV_NAME] --all`  

You can click your Anaconda app to upgrade, then reopen your terminals.
Or you can try using a cmd to upgrade, but you may need to download.

	conda update -n base -c defaults conda

[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

To open, run in the folder containing the .ipynb files you're editing.

	jupyter notebook



To always run conda when opening a terminal. You'll see (base)

	conda config --set auto_activate_base true

Turn off (base). 

	conda config --set auto_activate_base false

<!--
Neither fixes "error: externally-managed-environment"
Use a pyenv virtual environment to resolve.
-->

## Docker

[Docker download](https://www.docker.com) - Install and you'll see an elephant icon

If the docker cmd is not recognized after installing Docker on a Mac, Create a symbolic link. Then confirm with `docker --version`

	sudo ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker /usr/local/bin/docker

<!--
On a Mac, if the `docker` cmd is not recognized, go to your **Users\\[username]** folder and edit one of these hidden files corresponding to your command terminal instance: .zshrc, .bash_profile, .bashrc or .profile. Add the path `$HOME/.docker/bin` with these:

	export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
	export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"
-->

If you're transitioning from an old instance of [Docker](https://www.docker.com), you may need to reinstall or do a Docker reboot.

<!--
	docker --version
	docker which


Removed these from end of .zshrc
First maybe from ChatGPT.

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"

export PATH="$HOME/.docker/bin:$PATH"
-->

<!--
My machine has four found:

/Users/X/opt/anaconda3
/Users/X/opt/anaconda3/envs/myenv
base  *  /opt/anaconda3
myenv    /opt/anaconda3/envs/myenv



I ran the new install script in the root of the projects folder with no addition venv
bash location/setup/script/start.sh

After about 8 minutes, it got to the backend install and returned a line 20 error:

/etc/profile.d/conda.sh: No such file or directory

-->



<!--
Probably not needed:

Run if your version of conda won't update on your Mac. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75988022/conda-wont-update-on-macos)

	brew install python &&
	conda install -n base -c defaults 'conda>=24.3.0'

For the python install, you may also need to run:

	xcode-select --install

Type "python" followed by hitting tab key to see your python versions.

Make python3.12 (or a newer version) the main version on your system:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74343871/how-do-i-fix-my-python-version-showing-up-in-terminal

	# If you already have a python sym-link or binary file there, rename it
	sudo mv /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/python-

	# create sym-link to python3.11
	sudo ln -s `which python3.12` /usr/local/bin/python

	# check the version
	python --version
-->

<!--

After running brew install python

Says 3.12, but python --version returns 3.8.5

==> No broken dependents to reinstall!
==> Caveats
==> python@3.12
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.12/libexec/bin

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
==> pipx
zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
==> postgresql@14
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgresql@14
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-initdb.html

To start postgresql@14 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@14
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/postgresql@14/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@14
